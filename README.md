# KotOR-Modding-Guide
This guide is a work in progress, and is part of the Northern Lights project (a level editor and engine reimplementation project for KotOR/TSL).

The guide consists of three components:
 - An extensive wiki explaining how to mod KotOR/TSL, from simple to complex mods
 - Full examples of many different types of mods, complete with documentation describing how the mods work
 - Templates for many common modding tasks, such as adding new items/characters/..., creating new modules, total conversions, etc.
 
## Sample Mods
### Easier mods

#### Adding items


#### Changing appearances


#### Creating new dialogs


#### Implementing new scripts


#### Adding new characters


#### Adding a new merchant


### More complex mods

#### Adding a new module


#### Creating quests


#### Adding party members


### A (simple) total-conversion mod
Total conversion mods are mods that, essentially, implement an entirely new game within the game engine (replacing KotOR/TSL). These mods are ambitious, and a lot of work, but there are successful examples of them (The Jedi Masters, Revenge of Revan, etc.)

## Modding templates

### New modules

### Total conversions
